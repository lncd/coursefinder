Course Finder
============

Course Finder is a demonstration of possible uses for university course data. Using Open Calais, Course Finder makes links between courses of study based on identified keywords. Combining this with subjects covered by the courses, as well as recommendations by previous users of the system, a more detailed and potentially more useful course finder application can be produced. 

Course Finder has been developed as part of the ON Course Project at The Univeristy of Lincoln, a JISC-funded project.

Course Finder is most definitely still in Alpha.
